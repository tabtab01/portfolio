            Glad you made it. Have a seat and let's have a conversation. My name is Tabitha and I am on the greatest journey 
            ever embarked upon, life. I have no idea who I am. I'm someone. A human. I matter to some people. I don't matter to other people. Some people matter to me, others do not.
            I am a mother first in all things I do. I have overcome many things that were far beyond my years and yet I still have many lessons that I need to learn.
            My life is a series of failures and accomplishments and that is something I am very proud of. Particularly, Road to Hire, a nonprofit that teaches leadership
            and technology to young adults who may not have the opportunity otherwise. The opportunity Road to Hire has presented me with has been a monumental 
            step in my life that I am very grateful for.

            Before Road to Hire I was working at Lotus Boutique and Designs as a seamstress. I was first introduced to the position at Lotus 
            nearly 2 years ago and had little prior knowledge of sewing and interior design. Fast forward a year later and I was working as head seamstress
            before I came to Gateway with Road to Hire.
